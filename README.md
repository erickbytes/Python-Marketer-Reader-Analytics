# Python-Marketer-Reader-Analytics
Where in the world do people read about Python?

This is dataset is a combination of:

1) Python Marketer blog (pythonmarketer.com) reader data collected by Wordpress, my blogging platform.

2) The "Population by Country - 2020" dataset from Kaggle.

In the "Calculating Python Per Capita Coefficient by Country" jupyter notebook, i'm playing around with a "Learner Coefficient",
which is my attempt at a population adjusted ranking for comparing significance of readers against their nation's population size.
