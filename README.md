# PythonMarketer.com Blog Reader Analytics
Where in the world do people read about Python?

This is dataset is a combination of:

1) Python Marketer blog (pythonmarketer.com) reader data collected by Wordpress, my blogging platform.

2) The "Population by Country - 2020" dataset from Kaggle.

There are two notebooks you can view:

1) [**"Calculating Python Per Capita Coefficient by Country"**](https://github.com/erickbytes/Python-Marketer-Reader-Analytics/blob/master/Calculating%20%22Python%20Per%20Capita%22%20Blog%20Reader%20Coefficient.ipynb)- jupyter notebook, explores a "Learner Coefficient",
which is my attempt at a population adjusted ranking for comparing significance of readers against their nation's population size.

2) [**"2020 Blog Reader Analysis for pythonmarketer.com.ipynb"**](https://github.com/erickbytes/Python-Marketer-Reader-Analytics/blob/master/2020%20Blog%20Reader%20Analysis%20for%20pythonmarketer.com.ipynb)
- A summary of 2020 reader data from pythonmarketer.com, collected by the Wordpress blogging platform.
